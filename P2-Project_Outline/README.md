# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Create an app in which a user could add ingredients to a grocery list, those ingredients would be added as inventory into a database, then the user could use those items to create meals/recipes. We should break those ingredients down by protein, carb, veg, etc. Once items are used, they are removed from the current inventory, which would also let the user know when items need to be replenished. Ideally, the user would never be without the full ingredients to make a meal, they would also know when it was time to go grocery shopping, and what items needed to be purchased. There is nothing worse than having to make a grocery list, or decide what's for dinner. 
### Features
1. Users can create/authenticate accounts: must log in in order to get into the app
2. Are able to CRUD ingredients to grocery/recipe list
3. Add tags that identify if an ingredient is a protein, carb, fats once they are removed from current inventory
4. Notification window to let the user know when ingredients need to be replaced
5. Able to sort ingredients by type
### Technologies
Java

JavaScript 

SpringBoot

React.JS - UI

MySQL 

Java Persistence API - JPA

### What I'll Have to Learn
This will be a great opportunity to brush up on JavaScript skills that was the main focus from LC101 unit 1. Additionally, I will need to learn how to combine React.JS with SpringBoot to create the front and back end respectively. Thymeleaf will be used, however, a plug in will direct react as the rendered output. I must also learn to launch the backend with a fully functional REST API method with SpringBoot. The 'learning a new technology' prerequisite I decided to choose React as the new skill to tackle but I am definitely open to suggestions on new frameworks or avenues to pursue for this application! I think using available data from a public API with a list of foods could be a viable option. Some conditional logic will be needed as far as notifications and updates when the recipe list is created from the raw data aka ingredients.
